# Auto Complete

AutoComplete is project-based on real-time data. In this project, I have used an API that predicts the country name you are about to type.

Note: I wanted to use a dictionary API that will predict the word I am about to type, but unfortunately I couldn't find a free one.

I have kept the UI lightweight by not doing the filtering on the client side.
